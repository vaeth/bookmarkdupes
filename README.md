A WebExtension which can display/remove duplicate bookmarks, empty folders, or descriptions

After installing bookmarkdupes, the usage is rather simple:

Click on bookmardupes' symbol (duplicate stars) and then
select in the popup window what you want to display:

1. Bookmark duplicates (exact)
2. Bookmark duplicates (similar)
3. Empty folders
4. All bookmarks

The difference between 1 and 2 is that in case

1. The URLs of the bookmarks must match exactly
2. The URLs of the bookmarks must match up to the first ? symbol;
   the URL text after the ? symbol is appended to the displayed bookmark.

After this, you will be offered the list of all bookmark with checkboxes.
There are also button to select/unselect convenient sets of checkboxes.

Finally, there are buttons to remove the selected bookmarks in case 1-3,
or to strip the descriptions of the selected bookmarks in case 4.

Be aware that stripping of descriptions works by replacing the bookmark by
a freshly created one. In particular, it updates the internally stored date
when the bookmark was added.

When you close the popup window and removal of bookmarks/comments is not
yet finished, it will continue in the background.
