# ChangeLog for squashmount

*bookmarkdupes-2.4:
	可称呼我YF，或随意。网名的本义是YF的用户000。 <yfdyh000 at gmail.com>:
	- Create zh_CN locales

	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Indicate age of bookmarks by numbers
	- Add buttons to mark all but oldest/newest bookmarks, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/9
	- Pick bookmark index from bookmark API instead of counting, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/11

*bookmarkdupes-2.3:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Serious bugfix (regression): Stripping of bookmarks failed, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/8

*bookmarkdupes-2.2:
	Henaro aka Ironwool:
	- Create uk locales
	- Create ru locales

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Create es locales

	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Display total number of bookmarks
	- Calculate in background
	- Calculate optionally asynchronously (not yet used)

*bookmarkdupes-2.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Display result of removing/stripping only once

*bookmarkdupes-2.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Continue removing/stripping in background if popup is closed,
	  and redisplay current state when popup is re-opened:
	  Other things can be done even if stripping should take ages.
	  Moreover, this solves the bug that when the popup was closed during
	  stripping in a bad moment, a bookmark might have been duplicated.
	- Add a progress bar for removing/stripping
	- Disable buttons visibly when locked
	- Hash bookmark data when searching all bookmarks, resulting in
	  slightly slower search but considerably faster stripping
	- Refactor searching, resulting in possibly slight speedup
	- Fix typo in localization id (causing strange or empty message)
	- Bugfix for detection of bookmark type
	- Various minor typo fixes in text messages

*bookmarkdupes-1.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Show progress when removing/stripping
	- Add emergency stop button
	- More specific messages
	- Use textContent instead of redundant child text nodes
	- Bugfix: Removing/stripping empty lists might have locked buttons
	- Code cleanup: remove unused arguments

*bookmarkdupes-0.5
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Avoid unsafe assignment to innerHTML

*bookmarkdupes-0.4
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- bookmarkdupes can now also strip descriptions of bookmarks
	- Buttons accept now only left mouse button
	- Update description
	- Serialize removal of bookmarks: slower, but the only reliable way to
	  handle certain errors, e.g. if another extension modifies bookmarks
	- Avoid global variables: use nested functions and closures only

*bookmarkdupes-0.3
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- bookmarkdupes can now also display/remove empty bookmark folders
	- Unmodifiable and other strange bookmarks are more reliably excluded
	- Bugfix in handling of strange events

*bookmarkdupes-0.2
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	- Display ignored parts of URLs for similar bookmarks
	- Unselect all by default to minimize risk of accidental deletion
	- Internationalization
	- Provide German translation
	- Fix error catcher for bookmark removal
	- Improve code clarity for lock handling
