	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/56

*bookmarkdupes-5.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Change layout of "expert mode" table slightly, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/52

	Henaro aka Ironwool:
	- Update uk locales
	- Update ru locales

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Update es locales

*bookmarkdupes-5.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add expert rules to ignore ("filter") certain bookmarks.
	  Storage permissions are required to store these expert rules in
	  the local or sync storage.
	- Expert rules can define when bookmarks are considered as dupes.
	  This replaces the previous unsatisfactory "Similar Dupes" button and
	  implements also https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/45
	- Default expert rules deal with much more than \? tails.
	  Actually, the \? tails rule is now by default deactivated because it
	  has too many false positives: only relatively safe rules are active
	  in the defaults, and in addition one locale-specific example of a
	  filter rule.
	- Remove tabs permissions.
	  The price is that several tabs open when clicked several times
	- bugfix: increase minimal gecko version to 48.0 to reflect that
	  manifest.json itself apparently requires that version, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/44
	- bugfix: calculation error messages are now displayed correctly
	- bugfix: use safe (guaranteed non-duplicate) ids for bookmarks
	- bugfix: add some forgotten semicolons. Another missing semicolon
	  (in menwhile changed code) might also have been a reason for
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/38
	  However, currently the options page is not removed: some users might
	  find it convenient.
	- internal: remove redundant SplitNumber
	- internal: avoid arguments array when simple args passing will do
	- internal: improve some function names

	Henaro aka Ironwool:
	- Update uk locales
	- Update ru locales

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Update es locales

*bookmarkdupes-4.2:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add an options page with a link as an alternative way to open the
	  extension. This is mainly meant as a workaround for
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/38

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Update es locales

*bookmarkdupes-4.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

*bookmarkdupes-4.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use tab instead of panel

	  In a tab there is no need to save state in a background process.
	- Speed up counting of marks
	- Display bookmarks as links
	- Display URLs common to groups only once
	- Support folder selection (instead of only 2 categories)
	- Provide buttons for not marking first/last/oldest/newest for folders

	  Thanks to perdolka for the idea:
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/32
	- Display list titles in more places
	- Try to force display syncing with setTimeout
	- Disable checkboxes while updating them
	- Add a checkbox to disable counting
	- bugfix: mark also last group for folder/category selection

*bookmarkdupes-2.4:

	- Add buttons to mark all but oldest/newest bookmarks, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/9
	- Display number of marked bookmarks
	- Document that stripping descriptions changes internally stored date
	- Document necessity to recalculate after bookmark changes
	- Prefer bookmark index from bookmark API (if it exists) over counting.
	  This might mitigate https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/11
	- internal: remove currently unused asynchronous code
	- internal: use null instead of {} to free closures

*bookmarkdupes-2.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Display result of removing/stripping only once

*bookmarkdupes-2.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Continue removing/stripping in background if popup is closed,
	  and redisplay current state when popup is re-opened:
	  Other things can be done even if stripping should take ages.
	  Moreover, this solves the bug that when the popup was closed during
	  stripping in a bad moment, a bookmark might have been duplicated.
	- Add a progress bar for removing/stripping
	- Disable buttons visibly when locked
	- Hash bookmark data when searching all bookmarks, resulting in
	  slightly slower search but considerably faster stripping

	  handle certain errors, e.g. if another extension modifies bookmarks
